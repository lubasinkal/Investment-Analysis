    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we collect historical market data for selected stocks using the yfinance library. The primary goal is to gather comprehensive datasets for analysis, visualization, and potential use in machine learning models. This project serves as an educational exercise to explore Python's capabilities in financial data analysis.\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "``Download Historical Stock Data:`` Retrieve historical data for selected stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "``Store Data Efficiently:`` Save the collected data in a structured format for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "``Maintain Data Quality:`` Ensure data completeness and accuracy."

    "\n",
    "This notebook lays the foundation for the broader investment analysis project. By systematically collecting and storing data, we set the stage for in-depth analysis and machine learning applications. As the project evolves, we will expand the scope to include more data sources and advanced analytical techniques.\n",
