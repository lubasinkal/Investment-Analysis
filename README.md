# Investment Analysis
##### Before you read through the repo just know... I've `used` Vim btw. 🧙🏾‍♂️
## Overview

This repository is a personal project to explore and learn about the use of Python, Excel, data analysis and machine learning in the context of finance and investment. The primary focus is on understanding how these tools and techniques can be applied to analyze financial data and make informed decisions.

### PROJECT GOALS
- ``Learning and Experience:`` Gain hands-on exeperience with Python programming, data analysis and machine learning techniques.
- ``Understanding Financial Applications:`` Learn how data analysis can be used in finance and investment to interpret market trends, assess risks, and optimize portfolios.
- ``Data Analysis and Visualization:`` Use of libraries like pandas, numpy and matplotlib, to name a few, to analyse market data and create visyualizations that enhance understanding of financial metrics.
- ``Machine Learning:`` Experiment with machine learninf models to explore their potential in predicting stock performance amd optimizing investment strategies.

## Note
### Skill issues...😂
Just recently started this project so if you see this there might be things missing... I'm workin on it. Bear in mind that I'm still learing and exploring concepts. Expect beginner tendencies here and there. The project is a work in progress and I plan to refine it with time. Any advice or guidance is welcome.
